# CS251
CS251 provides an introduction to the theoretical foundations and practical aspects of data structures and algorithms. Topics will include: fundamental data structures (e.g., arrays, stacks, queues, trees, tries, hash tables, graphs), fundamental algorithms (e.g., sorting, radix sorting, pattern matching, topological sorting, shortest path, minimum spanning tree), and their implementations (e.g., asymptotic and average running time analysis, implementations of red-black trees, and adjacency matrix implementations of graphs).
